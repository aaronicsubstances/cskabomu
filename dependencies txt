- generalization of OS shell jobs, docker --init or unix init mechanism, to guarantee that a child process cannot outlive its parent process.
- system administration function for monitoring process group
- networked database which allows ACID transaction management by one process, for the rest of the processes in a process group
- in-memory cache with time-to-live and eviction notification support, to host non-serializable global variables
- precursor to networked memory database like redis, to host serializable global variables (e.g. SQLite in-memory mode managed by one process, for the rest of the processes in a process group)
- precursor to log-based message broker like kafka, to support deferred request processing (e.g. Hangfire, Resque, custom message broker based on Kabomu)
