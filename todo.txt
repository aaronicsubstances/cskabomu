tests
-----
DefaultEventLoopApi
QuasiHttpKeyValueCollection
QuasiHttpPdu (serialization)
DefaultQuasiHttpClient
DefaultQuasiHttpApplication

default transports
------------------
MemoryBasedTransport
UdpBasedTransport - making it async may require use of third party library
UnixSocketBasedTransport - availability and making it async may require use of third party library

default middleware
------------------
-json
-string
-form
-byte buffer

default bodies
---------------
-jsonbody
-stringbody
-formbody
-bytebufferbody
*filebody - making it async may require use of third party library
*streambody - making it async may require use of third pary library

Optimization
------------
1. Let receive/send make use of event loop always on same thread
2. For large timeouts (as determined by a config setting), introduce a single bulk polling timer
   in receive/send to skip timer creation until time remaining becomes small.
   a. still create timers for case of small timeouts.
3. Reduce byte copying towards zero as much as possible

Examples
--------
-add demos each for udp, unix domain socket and memory
--based on single discard peer configurable with different ports, for bouncing headers back n forth 
  to mimick ping-pong benchmarking
--based on file server/client
--copy over command line parsing
