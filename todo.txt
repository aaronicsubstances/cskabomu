default transports
------------------
MemoryBasedTransport - done
LocalhostTcpTransport - making it async may require use of third party library
UnixSocketDomainTransport - availability and making it async may require use of third party library
WindowsNamedPipeTransport - availability and making it async may require use of third party library

default middleware
------------------
-json
-csv
-string
-byte buffer

Optimization
------------
1. Let receive/send make use of event loop always on same thread - done via mutex.
2. For large timeouts (as determined by a config setting), introduce a single bulk interval timer
   in receive/send to skip timer creation until time remaining becomes small.
   a. still create timers for case of small timeouts.
3. Reduce byte copying towards zero as much as possible

Examples
--------
-add demos for memory transport
--based on file server/client
