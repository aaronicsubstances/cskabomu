remaining (can skip if library works with all examples)
==========
-introduce enough timeout gaps to remove flakiness of QuasiHttpIntegrationTestOne
-add more tests for StandardQuasiHttpServer, ProtocolUtilsInternal
-introduce cycle detection in ContextExtensions.FlattenException, 
  as well as cater for AggregateException having multiple inner exceptions,
  or get a utility method in some library to use for entire method.
-introduce zero bufferingLimit as default in TransportUtils.ReadBodyToMemoryStream
-consider moving MemoryPipeBackedBody and TransportBackedBody to join the rest of the body implementations, now that
 memory based transport is purged from project.
-resolve need for VirtualTimeBasedEventLoopApi once and for all
