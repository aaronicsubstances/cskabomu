default transports
------------------
MemoryBasedTransport
UdpBasedTransport - making it async may require use of third party library
UnixSocketBasedTransport - availability and making it async may require use of third party library
WindowsNamedPipes - availability and making it async may require use of third party library

*let udptransport care only about creating connections with uuids to prevent external duplicates.
assign variable length integers to chunk get/ret types and 
deal with duplication internally - both resp, and chunk, and fins.
make retry logic external component based on pdu req res pairs and sequence number replacements within same pair.

default middleware
------------------
-json
-csv
-string
-byte buffer

default bodies
---------------
-jsonbody
-stringbody
-formbody
-bytebufferbody
*filebody - making it async may require use of third party library
*streambody - making it async may require use of third pary library

Optimization
------------
1. Let receive/send make use of event loop always on same thread
2. For large timeouts (as determined by a config setting), introduce a single bulk interval timer
   in receive/send to skip timer creation until time remaining becomes small.
   a. still create timers for case of small timeouts.
3. Reduce byte copying towards zero as much as possible

Examples
--------
-add demos each for udp, unix domain socket, windows named pipe, and memory
--based on file server/client
--copy over command line parsing
