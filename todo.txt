remaining
==========
-introduce enough timeout gaps to remove flakiness of QuasiHttpIntegrationTestOne
-StandardQuasiHttpClient
-StandardQuasiHttpServer

-move entire MemoryBasedTransport namespace to testing project.

-remove SynchronizedBody - done

-delete VirtualEventLoopApi and find alternative for its usage during testing. - done

-remove TransportBypassProbability and ResponseStreamingProbability of IQuasiHttpClient. - done
-instead always use TransportBypass if not null. - done
-and let response streaming be disabled by default. - done
-rename ResponseStreamingEnabled to ResponseBuferringEnabled - done

-repurpose TransportBypassProbability as TransportBypassWrappingProbability - done

*let return value of TransportBypass be Pair<Task<IDirectSendResult>, object>
-IDirectSendResult are the response and indication of whether response closing is necessary.

*Remove resets - done
--hence stop storing transfers - done

-create memorybasedtransport in examples

*reconsider use of callbacks for other languages lacking async/await syntax now that memorybasedtransport has been removed.

default transports - keep in examples, later migrate to Kabomu.StandardAddons
------------------
LocalhostTcpTransport - making it async may require use of third party library. 
-consider connect/read timeout usage - https://www.baeldung.com/java-socket-connection-read-timeout
UnixSocketDomainTransport - availability and making it async may require use of third party library

-URL Path validation middleware (based on https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1630). 
    1. Valid path characters aside forward slash and percent encoding %xx (ISO-8859-1): A–Z a–z 0–9 . - _ ~ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; = : @

-Header validation middleware
    1. key or value cannot contain newlines
    2. case sensitive keys only
    3. keys starts with English alphabet, and can contain other English alphabets, hyphens or decimal digits.
    4. values: only printable ASCII.
    3. the following headers are reserved for use by HTTP protocol, and hence will be ignored or lead to errors if set by clients for transmission over HTTP: content-length, transfer-encoding (fixed to "chunked"), trailer, te, upgrade, connection, keep-alive, proxy-authenticate, proxy-authorization, accept-encoding (fixed to "identity"), content-encoding.
    4. See also https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3


Optimize - reduce zero byte copy - v1.2.0?
-----------------------------------------
Created ExtendedTransport interface
-Add canTransferBody(body)->bool and transferBody - to support any  future sendfile/transmitfile
Create ExtendedBody interface
-Add canreadslices and readslices - takes a maxchunksize param, and returns slices.
  - of interest to extended transport and chunk encoding body.
-Have to still support readbytes and give ExtendedTransport the option to choose.
