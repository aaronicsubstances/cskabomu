default source and sinks
------------------------
-add a sink which embeds a source, and a soure which embeds a sink
-leave it to another library to provide sources and sinks backed by async streams, which will likely need 3rd party libs like Netty, Vert.x, Twisted and ReactPHP.

----------
keep csv utils for quasi http? so we don't have a dependency on some library.
