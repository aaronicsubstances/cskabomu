==========
-introduce enough timeout gaps to remove flakiness of QuasiHttpIntegrationTestOne
-DefaultQuasiHttpClient
-DefaultQuasiHttpServer
-delete VirtualEventLoopApi and find alternative for its usage during testing.
-move entire MemoryBasedTransport namespace to testing project.
-remove TransportBypassProbability and ResponseStreamingProbability of IQuasiHttpClient.
--instead always use TransportBypass if not null.
--always disable response streaming if not set by send options.
-let return value of TransportBypass be a dedicated class instead of current tuple,
--consisting of cancellation handle, response, and whether response streaming should be enabled.
-create memorybasedtransport in examples, with a probability similar to ResponseStreamingProbability
--apply probability twice to wrap request bodies in ContentTypeOverrideBody
  or SynchronizedBody just to force server to read bytes; 
  and to return response streaming boolean to client
-fix SynchronizedBody lack of application of mutex api.

other default transports - keep in examples, later migrate to Kabomu.StandardAddons
------------------
LocalhostTcpTransport - making it async may require use of third party library. 
-consider connect/read timeout usage - https://www.baeldung.com/java-socket-connection-read-timeout

-URL Path validation middleware (based on https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1630). 
    1. Valid path characters aside forward slash and percent encoding %xx (ISO-8859-1): A–Z a–z 0–9 . - _ ~ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; = : @

-Header validation middleware
    1. key or value cannot contain newlines
    2. case sensitive keys only
    3. keys starts with English alphabet, and can contain other English alphabets, hyphens or decimal digits.
    4. values: only printable ASCII.
    3. the following headers are reserved for use by HTTP protocol, and hence will be ignored or lead to errors if set by clients for transmission over HTTP: content-length, transfer-encoding (fixed to "chunked"), trailer, te, upgrade, connection, keep-alive, proxy-authenticate, proxy-authorization, accept-encoding (fixed to "identity"), content-encoding.
    4. See also https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3


Optimize - reduce zero byte copy - v1.2.0?
-----------------------------------------
Created ExtendedTransport interface
-Add canTransferBody(body)->bool and transferBody - to support any  future sendfile/transmitfile
Create ExtendedBody interface
-Add canreadslices and readslices - takes a maxchunksize param, and returns slices.
  - of interest to extended transport and chunk encoding body.
-Have to still support readbytes and give ExtendedTransport the option to choose.
